# Sales-Customer-Performance-Dashboards

### Executive Summary
Using Tableau, with Sales and Customers dataset i built two interactive dashboards to track and analyze sales and customer performance. The **Sales Dashboard** presents metrics such as total sales, profit, and quantity; highlights monthly performance; and compares product subcategory performance. The **Customers Dashboard** focuses on customer-level insights: number of customers, average sales per customer, order distributions, and the top 10 most profitable customers.

### Business Problem
Organizations often lack visibility into how sales and customers evolve over time.

- Sales teams struggle to see which months or product categories drive revenue or drag it down.

- Marketing and management teams lack clarity about customer loyalty, order frequency, and profitability.

- Without consolidated, interactive dashboards, teams react to problems rather than anticipate them.

This project addresses these gaps by combining sales and customer analytics into a unified, interactive environment.
